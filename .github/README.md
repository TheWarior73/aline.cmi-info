Do not copy the work located in the `/USMB/` part of this repository.\
For obvious reasons, most of that work has been handed to college for assignments and grading, using my work in your assignments will get you in trouble.\
If you wish to use my work for other purposes, I do grant permission to use it as long as there are no malicious intents and that all work has due recognition of it's original author/inspiration [me]


> [!TIP]
> I have provided offline file.s for the grade calculator, find [them here](./grades_calc), you can find online files over [there](http://aline.cmi-info.fr/USMB/COEFS/) (you do not have to download anything to use it)

> [!INFO]
> While there is currently only the 1st Year calculator, I plan on adding the 2nd and 3rd year once I get more data about grades and coefficients.

Is the subdomain where my website resides, it is hosted by a friend.

In the even where I change hosts, or url, I keep my files backed up here. 
It also serves a purpose to auto update the website (with a webhook)

Time wasted doing css, js, messing with svgs and writting shady php code
